# unreachableElement

unreachableElement is a jQuery plugin which when called on any page element
will cause it to move to different parts of the screen every time a user 
would hover their mouse pointer over it

It can be used in the following manner :
    $(selector).unreachableElement(true);
    
To disable it, do the following :
    $(selector).unreachableElement(false);
    
Where $(selector) would represent the element you'd like to
attach unreachableElement to.
